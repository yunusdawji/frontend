**NOTE: In angular-gauge 2.x, some breaking changes have been introduced. If you are upgrading from `v1.x.x` version to `v2.x.x` then checkout the [Upgrade Guide](#upgrade-guide) first.**

# Usage

### Install using npm

```
npm install angularjs-gauge
```
### Install using Bower

```
bower install angularjs-gauge
```

### Install manually

```
git clone https://github.com/ashish-chopra/angular-gauge.git
```

Copy the files from `dist/` manually into your project folder.Then, add the script to your code (after adding the dependency of Angular 1.5) and resolving the paths as given below:

```html
<head>
  ...
<head>
<body>
  ...
</body>
  <script src="vendor/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
  <script src="vendor/angularjs-gauge/dist/angularjs-gauge.min.js"></script>
```

Add as dependency in your module

```js
angular.module('yourApp', ['angularjs-gauge']);

Use it in your HTML markup like this

```html
<ng-gauge size="200" type="full" thick="5" min="0" max="120" value="68.2" cap="round" label="Speed"  foreground-color="#ffcc66" background-color="rgba(255,255,255, 0.4)" append="mph"></ng-gauge>
```

# Config Options

There are plenty of configurable options available to tune the `Gauge` as per your needs.

| Name      | Description  | Required  | Default value  | Possible values |
| ---       | ---          | ---       | ---               | ---            |
| `size`    | Specifies the size of the canvas in which Gauge will be drawn. It is used as `width` and `height` both. | No       | `200` | Positive Integer           |
| `type`      | Specifies the gauge's type.                     | No        | `"full"`     |  `"full"`, `"semi"`, `"arch"`  |
| `min`  | Specifies the minimum numeric value for gauge's scale.  | No     | `0`  | Any numeric value  |
| `max` | Specified the maximum numeric value for gauge's scale. | No       | `100`  | Any numeric value  |
| `value`          | Specifies the current value of the Gauge in the range specified by `min` and `max`. It is a required attribute.       | Yes       | `undefined`  | Any numeric value |
| `cap`       | The style of line ending at the gauge's end.    | No        | `"butt"`    | `"round"`, `"butt"`           |
| `thick`        | Specified the thickness of the gauge's bar.            | No        | `6`        | Any Positive Integer |
| `label`       | Specifies the text to display below the Gauge's reading.  | No  | `undefined`                | Any String           |
| `foreground-color`         | Specifies the foreground color of the Gauge's scale.                    | No       | `rgba(0, 150, 136, 1)`             |   Any color value string       |
| `background-color`    | Specifies the background color of the Gauge's scale.| No        |    `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`           |    Any color value string        |
| `append`   | Specifies a `string` appended to the Gauge's reading. For example `"%"` most commonly used. | No        | `undefined`        | Any string           |
| `prepend`      | Specifies a `string` prepended to the Gauge's reading. For example `"$"` in case of financial data displayed in Gauge.                                        | No        | `undefined`            | Any String           |
| `duration`    | Specifies the duration (in milliseconds) of the Gauge's animation | No       | `1500` | Positive Integer           |
| `thresholds` | Specifies an object of threshold values at which the gauge's color changes. Checkout an example [here](#configure-threshold-color-ranges).  | No |  `none` | {} |
| `label-only` | Only label specified by `label` attribute is shown, when set to `true`. | No | `false` | `true`, `false` |
| `fraction-size` | Number of decimal places to round the number to. If this is not provided then the fraction size is computed from the current locale's number formatting pattern. | No | `none` | Positive Integer |

# Global Defaults

angular-gauge ships with a provider to globally set config options for all gauge instances used in the application during angular config phase. You can specify `ngGaugeProvider` dependency during `config` phase. It supports a single API to set config options:

```js
ngGaugeProvider.setOptions(customOptions);
```

Here, `customOptions` is an object `{}` where keys are the configOptions name (in camelCase notation), mentioned in above section. For example, let see how to set `size`, `cap`, `thick`, `foreground-color` and `background-color` options  globally using provider as shown below:

```js

angular
  .module('myApp', ['angularjs-gauge'])
  .config(configApp);

  configApp.$inject = ['ngGaugeProvider'];
  function configApp(ngGaugeProvider) {

    // setting the default parameters for
    // gauge instances globally.
    ngGaugeProvider.setOptions({
        size: 250,
        cap: 'round',
        thick: 15,
        foregroundColor: "#ff8645",   // note the camelCase notation for parameter name
        backgroundColor: "#e4e4e4"
    });

  }

```

## Configure Threshold Color Ranges

You can customize the colors of the gauge based on the current value being shown. This feature is introduced in `v2.1.0`. Make sure to update your local copy before using this feature. 

In order to show different colors when gauge crosses certain value, use property `thresholds`. It takes an object with the threshold value  as `key` and an object with `color` property as `value`. For example: 

```js
....

var threshold = {
  '0': {color: 'green'},
  '40': {color: 'orange'},
  '75.5': {color: 'red'}
};

....

```

```html
<ng-gauge ...  thresholds="threshold"></ng-gauge>
```
The keys in the threshold object signifies the minimum value at which the color will be applied. For instance, if the gauge's current value is `53.2`, then orange color will be applied because after point `40` every value will be displayed as `orange`, until next threshold is encountered. In this example `75.5` is the next threshold.

# Playground

The examples section is redesigned as a playground where you can play with Gauge by tuning its different parameters. 
And, you can see the result live on-screen. It is good start to get familiar with Gauge.

# Upgrade Guide

If you are upgrading from angular-gauge 1.x version to any version in 2.x family, then make sure to read the release notes of the chosen version on the [Releases](https://github.com/ashish-chopra/angular-gauge/releases) section.

Following are the breaking changes introduced in 2.x.x onwards:
1. `used` and `total` attributes are removed.
2. `min` and `max` attributes are introduced which works with `value` attribute. Checkout [config options](#config-options) to know more about their usage.

```shell
$> npm start             # starts the server at port 3000 and hosts the `/examples` directory.
$> npm test              # runs test suite once and exit.
$> npm run test:watch    # starts the test framework and watch for changes in code.
$> npm run build         # triggers a manual build for library, outputs at `/dist` directory.
```

3. To add a new feature or fix a bug, make sure to create a new branch from `master`.


First thing first, explore the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ashish-chopra/angular-gauge/issues) to find something to contribute. There are tons of other project setup related issues and activities in which you can help. Your feedback could also be a great contribution.
